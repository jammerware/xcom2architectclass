# Jammerware's Spire Runner Class
A mod for XCOM 2: War of the Chosen that adds the Spire Runner class.

## Design
The goal of the Spire Runner class is to encourage a spatially-driven play pattern and to create a unit with low offensive potential offset by powerful support abilities. It'd be nice if it were fun and balanced, too, but let's not get crazy.

### Allowed Weapons
**Primary**: Assault Rifle

**Secondary**: Spire Gun

### Perks

**SQUADDIE**

**Create Spire** - Summon a spire. Spires provide high cover.

| Rank | Fight | Flight |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| **CORPORAL** | **Field Reload Module** - *passive* - When you create a spire, it reloads the weapons of any allies adjacent to it. | **Shelter** - *passive* - Allies who end their turn adjacent to a spire gain a small shield. Shelter doesn't stack. |
| **SERGEANT** | **Headstone** - *free action, 3-turn cooldown* - Summon a spire on top of the corpse of an enemy unit. | **Reclaim** - *free action, 5-turn cooldown* - Destroy an adjacent spire. You gain one action point, and the cooldown of Create Spire is reset.  |
| **LIEUTENANT** | **Targeting Array** - *passive* - While adjacent to a spire, your (primary weapon) shots gain additional accuracy. This ability is available in the Training Center. | **Kinetic Rigging** - Your spires each gain one charge of *Kinetic Blast*, an ability that knocks back enemies in a cone-shaped area of effect. |
| **CAPTAIN** | **Relayed Shot** - *5-turn cooldown, consumes all ammo* - You fire your (primary weapon) at one of your spires. It amplifies the kinetic energy of the shot, increasing its effective range and overpenetrating all targets in the area of effect. | **Quicksilver** - *3-turn global cooldown* - Your spires gain Quicksilver, an ability that grants an adjacent ally an additional action point for the turn. |
| **MAJOR** | **Unity** - *passive* - You can summon spires adjacent to any ally. | **Transmat Link** - *free action, 5-turn cooldown* - Exchange locations with one of your spires. |
| **COLONEL** | **Soul of the Architect** - *passive* - All effects that apply to spires also apply to you. You gain all abilities your spires have. | **Transmat Network** - *passive* - Your spires gain *Transmat Network Node*, a passive ability which grants any adjacent squadmate the ability to instantly relocate to any tile adjacent to a spire in the same network. The squad ability has a 5-turn global cooldown. |

### GTS Perk
**Bolt from the Whoosh** - When a spire runner misses a shot, the bullet is returned to the magazine if they're using a boltcaster.

### Benched Abilities

*Lightning Rod* - Each spire emits a pulse in a 2-tile radius around it. Enemy units hit by the pulse take moderate damage and are stunned for a turn. Robotic enemies take extra damage.

*Onboard Scanner* - Scan the area around a spire. Grants vision and reveals invisible and hidden enemies. 1 charge per mission.

*Beta Design* - Spires now provide half cover. The cooldown of *Create Spire* is greatly reduced.

*Call Lightning* - Your spires gain *Call Lightning*, an ability that deals heavy damage to enemies in a line between the source and a target spire.

*Commence Run* - This turn, you gain extra mobility, and your detection radius is reduced by 30%. At the end of the turn, you return to the tile on which you began, and a spire appears on the one you ended. Insanely long cooldown.

*Impetus Module* - When you start your turn adjacent to a spire, you gain *Impetus*. Impetus grants additional mobility for a turn, and enemy you pass while under its effect is knocked back and dealt minor damage.

*Recall* - Teleport to a space adjacent to a spire. Long cooldown.

*Zap* - Your spires gain *Zap*, an ability that deals a small amount of damage to a target visible to the squad. (some kind of arc-soul like trait?)

*Speedyrun Knockaround Shootything* - Your spires gain *Speedyrun Knockaround Shootything*, an ability that spawns a hologram of you. The hologram lasts for one turn, and any enemy it passes while moving is knocked back. Medium global cooldown.
