# Jammerware's Spire Runner Class
A mod for XCOM 2: War of the Chosen that adds the Spire Runner class.

## Design
The goal of the Spire Runner class is to encourage the player's spatial awareness of the battlefield and to create a unit with extremely low offensive potential offset by powerful support abilities.

### Allowed Weapons
**Primary**: Spire Gun

**Secondary**: Pistol

### Perks

**Squaddie**
