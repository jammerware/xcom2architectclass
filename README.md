# Jammerware's Spire Runner Class
A mod for XCOM 2: War of the Chosen that adds the Spire Runner class.

## Design
The goal of the Spire Runner class is to encourage the player's spatial awareness of the battlefield and to create a unit with low offensive potential offset by powerful support abilities.

### Allowed Weapons
**Primary**: Assault Rifle

**Secondary**: Spire Gun

### Perks

**Squaddie**

*Create Spire* - Summon a spire. Spires provide high cover.

| Rank | Fight | Flight |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| **Corporal** | *Lightning Rod* - Each spire emits a pulse in a 2-tile radius around it. Enemy units hit by the pulse take moderate damage and are stunned for a turn. Robotic enemies take extra damage. | *Shelter* - Allies who end their turn adjacent to a spire gain a small shield. Shelter doesn't stack. |
| **Sergeant** |  | *Reclaim* - Destroy an adjacent spire. You gain one action point, and the cooldown of Create Spire is reset. |
| **Lieutenant** | *Targeting Array* - While adjacent to a spire, your pistol shots can't miss. This ability is available in the Training Center. | *i dunno. maybe something cross-classable?* |
| **Captain** | *Headstone* - Summon a spire on top of the corpse of an enemy unit.  | *Quicksilver* - Your spires gain Quicksilver, an ability that grants an adjacent ally an additional action point for the turn. 5-turn cooldown. |
| **Major** | | *Recall* - Instantly move to any space adjacent to a spire. 8-turn cooldown. |
| **Colonel** | *Unity* - You can summon spires adjacent to any ally. | *Soul of the Architect* - All effects that apply to spires also apply to you. You gain all abilities your spires have. |

**Pending Abilities**
*Onboard Scanner* - Scan the area around a spire. Grants vision and reveals invisible and hidden enemies. 1 charge per mission.
*Beta Design* - Spires now provide half cover. The cooldown of *Create Spire* is greatly reduced.
