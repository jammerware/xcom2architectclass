# Jammerware's Architect Class
A mod for XCOM 2: War of the Chosen that adds the Architect class. [Play it now](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1191669118) on Steam!

## Design
The goal of the Architect class is to encourage a spatially-driven play pattern and to create a unit with low offensive potential offset by powerful support abilities. It'd be nice if it were fun and balanced, too, but let's not get crazy.

### Allowed Weapons
**Primary**: Assault Rifle

**Secondary**: Forge

### Perks

**SQUADDIE**

**Create Spire** - Summon a spire. Spires provide high cover.

| Rank | Fight | Flight |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| **CORPORAL** | **Field Reload Array** - When you create a spire, it restores ammo to any allies adjacent to it. | **Shelter Array** - Allies who end their turn adjacent to a spire gain a shield. Shelter doesn't stack. |
| **SERGEANT** | **Headstone** - Summon a spire on top of the corpse of an enemy unit. | **Reclaim** - Destroy an adjacent spire. You gain one action point, and the cooldown of Create Spire is reset. |
| **LIEUTENANT** | **Relayed Shot** - You fire your (primary weapon) at one of your spires. It amplifies the kinetic energy of the shot, increasing its effective range and overpenetrating all targets in the area of effect. | **Targeting Array** - Your spires gain *Targeting Array*, a passive ability that enhances the accuracy of adjacent allies. |
| **CAPTAIN** | **Kinetic Rigging** - Your spires gain *Kinetic Blast*, an ability that knocks back enemies in a cone-shaped area of effect. The spire must be activated to use Kinetic Blast. | **Quicksilver Rigging** - Your spires gain charges of Quicksilver, an ability that grants an adjacent ally an additional action point for the turn. The spire must be activated to use Quicksilver.|
| **MAJOR** | **Unity** - You can summon spires adjacent to any ally. | **The Swapper** - Exchange locations with one of your spires. |
| **COLONEL** | **Soul of the Architect** - All effects that apply to your spires also apply to you. You gain all abilities your spires have. | **Transmat Network** - Your spires gain *Transmat Network Node*, a passive ability which grants any adjacent squadmate the ability to instantly relocate to any tile adjacent to a spire in the same network. |

### GTS Perk
**Bolt from the Whoosh** - When an Architect misses a shot, the bullet has a 50% chance to be returned to the magazine. If the magazine is empty, this chance is increased to 100%.
